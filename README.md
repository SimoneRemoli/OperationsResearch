### 2. Linear Programming Problems

- **Modeling real-world problems** with linear constraints and objective functions.
- **Example of a linear program:**
  ```plaintext
  maximize   cᵀx
  subject to Ax ≤ b
             x ≥ 0
  ```
- Applications in logistics, production planning, and resource allocation.
